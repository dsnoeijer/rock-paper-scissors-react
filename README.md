# Frontend Project

## Rock, Paper, Scissors
A rock, paper, scissors game build with React v18. Build as a single page application
with a mobile first design approach.

Scripts:

### `npm start`

Run the app locally.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
